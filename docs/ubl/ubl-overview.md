# ðŸ”· UBL Framework Overview

The **Universal Blueprint Loader (UBL)** is a framework that allows **actor blueprint mods** to dynamically interact with the game. It achieves this by:

- **Loading** actor blueprint mods into the game.
- **Processing custom Blueprint events** triggered within mods.
- **Handling event logic** through **UE4SS Lua scripts** (**UBLScripts**).

By combining **Unreal Engine Blueprints** with the flexibility of **Lua scripting**, UBL provides a robust system for creating **advanced mod interactions previously unattainable**.
